From the official website:
>## What is 6.824 about?
>6.824 is a core 12-unit graduate subject with lectures, readings, programming labs, an optional project, a mid-term exam,
>and a final exam. It will present abstractions and implementation techniques for engineering distributed systems. Major
>topics include fault tolerance, replication, and consistency. Much of the class consists of studying and discussing case
>studies of distributed systems.
