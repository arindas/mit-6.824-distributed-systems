## Overview
From the official [website](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824):
>### What is 6.824 about?
>6.824 is a core 12-unit graduate subject with lectures, readings, programming labs, an optional project, a mid-term exam,
>and a final exam. It will present abstractions and implementation techniques for engineering distributed systems. Major
>topics include fault tolerance, replication, and consistency. Much of the class consists of studying and discussing case
>studies of distributed systems.

This repository was created to serve as an environment for working on the labs.

The tests from the original source tree at [git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.824-golabs-2021](git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.824-golabs-2021)
have been preserved to a great extent to ensure the authenticity of the labs. The only changes to the tests are updated paths
for different artefacts due to the changes in the directory structure.

## Organization
The repository is organized as follows:
```
.
├── assets
│   └── logo.png
├── cmd
│   ├── diskvd
│   ├── lockservice
│   ├── mr
│   ├── pbservice
│   └── viewd
├── datasets
│   └── project-gutenberg
├── LICENSE
├── pkg
│   ├── kvraft
│   ├── labgob
│   ├── labrpc
│   ├── models
│   ├── mr
│   ├── porcupine
│   ├── raft
│   ├── shardctrler
│   └── shardkv
└── README.md
```

The core of each module is represented as a package under the `pkg/` subdirectories. Most of these packages are
accompanied by tests in the same directory. The user facing utlitiy command/program binaries are kept under `cmd/`.

## Labs Progress
Mark your progress with this checklist.

- [ ] Lab 1: MapReduce
- [ ] Lab 2: Raft Consensus Algorithm
  - [ ] Lab 2A: Raft Leader Election
  - [ ] Lab 2B: Raft Log Entries Append
  - [ ] Lab 2C: Raft state persistence
- [ ] Lab 3: Fault-tolerant Key/Value Service
  - [ ] Lab 3A: Key/value Service Without Log Compaction
  - [ ] Lab 3B: Key/value Service With Log Compaction
- [ ] Lab 4: Sharded Key/Value Service

## Testing
All of the labs from the original source tree has been migrated to go modules. Except for mapreduce, the tests for all
labs may be run as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/arindas/mit-6.824-distributed-systems.git
cd mit-6.824-distributed-systems
cd pkg/${PACKAGE_TO_TEST}
go test
```

For the mapreduce lab, run the tests as follows:
```shell
cd cmd/mr/scripts
bash test-mr.sh  # single trial
bash test-mr-many.sh $N_TRIALS  # multiple trials
```

## Building
Required binaries can be built by running `go build` in the respective `cmd/` subdirectories.
